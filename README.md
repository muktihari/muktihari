#### Hi, I'm Mukti 👋

I’m a software engineer who loves thinking philosophically when building systems—questioning assumptions, exploring trade-offs and designing with purpose—specializing in Go.

In life, I enjoy long-distance cycling, weekend hikes, and tinkering with embedded systems for DIY electronics.
